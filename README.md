-------------------
<p align="center">In Libft, we are tasked to redo a set of functions from "libc" library, as well as create some of our own.
Your functions will have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals. They must comply
with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names. They
will begin with the "ft_" prefix. For instance, "strlen" becomes "ft_strlen".</p>

<h3><b>¤ ISALPHA ¤</b></h3>

• DESCRIPTION •

<p align="left̨">The "is_alpha" function in C is a utility function that checks whether a given character is an alphabetic character (a letter). It returns a boolean
value indicating whether the character is a letter or not. It checks if the character is within the range of lowercase letters (a to z) or uppercase
letters (A to Z) using character comparison or character class functions like islower() or isupper().
